# Neural Networks Learning
## _Objective:_
Implement the backpropagation algorithm to learn the parameters for the neural network and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.

## _Dataset_

The data set contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits, where each training example is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. Each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is "unrolled" into a 400-dimensional vector.



## _Results_

Cost function after training the Neural Network (50 iterations): _0.04556_
